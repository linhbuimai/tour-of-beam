Early in my career, I founded two startups. One was Yunoo, a personal budgeting tool for the Dutch market. Four years after we launched, the company was acquired by a mid-sized local company in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) sector. I stayed with this ERP company for a year. But I had the startup bug in me, and so founded a second startup. This last one was a great adventure; we went to the US to join the TechStars 2013 accelerator. However, this startup failed miserably.

I was still recovering from this failure in 2015, when a friend who designed the first version of Uber– Jelle Prins – pinged me, and said Uber was kickstarting an engineering office in Amsterdam. By that time, I’d been following Uber for years, and suspected that the ridesharing industry would only get bigger.

My time at Uber was hypergrowth as its finest. In 2015 when I joined, we had 6 engineers in the Amsterdam office. Six years later, we were at 250 people. For most of my time, I was part of the Rider Payments team and worked for 4 years with Gergely.

In 2021, I left Uber for Rise Calendar as a technical co-founder. Rise is a beautiful calendar app that helps you schedule and protects your week. Since then, we’ve raised a pre-seed round – when Gergely got involved as an angel investor – and have grown the team to 7 people.

Having spent about 15 years split between startups and Big Tech, here’s my honest take on the good, the bad, and the “ugly” of each environment.
